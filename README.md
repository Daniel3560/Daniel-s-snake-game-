ðŸŽ® Project Overview

This is a classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It goes beyond the basics by adding chasing enemies that appear after a score of 1, and "shrink food" (orange squares) that make your snake shorter if eaten. It's a simple, fun, and challenging game that shows off core web development skills.

I have also made this game compatible with mobile allowing multiple platforms access the game.
