ðŸŽ® Project Overview
Daniel's Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game developed with HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, and JavaScript. This project serves as a demonstration of fundamental web development concepts, including game loop management, collision detection, and interactive user experiences.

It started as a basic Snake game and has evolved to include unique elements like chasing enemies and strategic "shrink food", adding layers of challenge and decision-making

ðŸš€ How to Play
Open index.html in your web browser.
Click the "Start Game" button.
Use your Arrow Keys (or W, A, S, D) to control the snake's direction.
Eat the red food to grow your snake and increase your score.
Watch out for the purple enemies! If they touch any part of your snake, it's game over.
Be cautious of the orange "shrink food"; eating it will make your snake shorter and reduce your score.
The game ends if your snake hits a wall, its own body, or an enemy.
Click "Play Again" to restart the fun!
